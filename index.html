      <h2>All About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a native of Jacksonville, FL. I love the game of basketball and have been playing since the age of 8. I played college basketball for Florida State College at Jacksonville (FSCJ), as well as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cmueagles.com/sports/wbkb/2015-16/roster">Central Methodist University</a>. I received my Bachelors Degree in Athletic Training in December 2016.</p>
      <p>I am creating this website as a way to help me become a Software Developer and to apply the few skills I have learned so far, and MORE!</p>
      <p>If you'd like to learn more about me, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mia-stone-8b8839108/">click here.</a></p>

      <h2>Ball is Life</h2>
      <p>I've been through a few trials and tribulations during my basketball career. However, there were many lessons learned. Without the game of basketball, I would not be the person that I am today. I would not have met some of the amazing people in my life, or have had the opportunity to travel to different parts of the country.</p>
      <h2>Amazon Learning Trainer</h2>
      <p>As a Learning Trainer at Amazon, I get the chance to meet new hires and transfers, and be a mentor for the Learning Ambassadors. Amazon not only has helped me to pursue a careeer in Software Development, but it has also connected me to people that I can network with now and in the future.</p>

      <h2>Software Development Journey</h2>
      <p>I first became interested in software development in September 2022. I came across a post at work about applying for the Amazon Technical Academy. Unfortunately, I did not make it past the final phase. However, I came across Correlation One at our Career Choice Fair and immediately applied. I love the course so far! I like how I have a teaching assistant (TA) and a Career Success Coach to help guide me on my journey. So far I have learned HTML and am currently learning about CSS. I can't wait to complete this course, start applying for jobs, and start my career. What I find most interesting is that as a web developer is that I will always learn something new and that being hands-on will help me along the way.</p>
